# Inlay Hint

All kinds of inlay hints are enabled by default.

## `types`

This inlay hint shows the types of globals, parameters, locals and struct fields in some instructions like `global.get`, `local.get`, `struct.get`.

## `ending`

This inlay hint shows the end boundary of functions and blocks.
It only shows when the function or block contains an identifier.

## `index`

This inlay hint shows numeric idx of functions, types, globals, memories, tables, tags and etc in their definitions.
This can be helpful when calling these functions or referencing these items elsewhere.
